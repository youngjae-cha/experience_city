# MACS 40123 Final Project Repository

This repository contains the final project for the course **MACS 40123: Large-Scale Data Mining for Social and Cultural Knowledge Discovery**.

## Project Context
The work for this project was conducted within my personal folder under my PI's project workspace (`soishi/yjcha`). Since the workspace was not synced with GitHub, I have uploaded the relevant code and visualization results here for sharing purposes.

## Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**  
  Contains code downloaded from the `midway3` workspace. These notebooks were used for analysis during the project.

- **`visualizations/`**  
  Stores figures summarizing the result patterns, organized by city for ease of interpretation.

## Analysis Procedure
The analysis followed these steps:
1. **Data Integration**:  
   Combined Google reviews that were initially separated by city and spatial type into a unified dataset.

2. **Semantic Direction Analysis**:  
   Applied the semantic direction method to estimate the psychological meaning of each review.

3. **Visualization**:  
   Plotted the psychological meanings at the levels of city and spatial type. This helped to analyze how different spaces within cities contribute to distinct psychological experiences.

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder to access the analysis code.
2. Explore the `visualizations/` folder to review city-specific result patterns.
